# Healthcare-Appointment-No-Show-Prediction
Missed healthcare appointments are a major challenge, leading to inefficiency, wasted 
resources, and delays in patient care. Hospitals face increased costs and lower service 
quality when patients do not attend scheduled visits. The objective of this project is to 
predict whether a patient will attend or miss an appointment, and provide insights to 
optimize scheduling.
